# dimension_reduction_effect_on_RSquare
Used PCA and manifold to reduce the dimensions from 257 to 83 on cardiac_arrhythmia data set. Compared Logistic Regression, KNN, and linear SVM models on both 257 and 83 components and found that there is not much difference in the R2. This is because of the co- relation among the components.
